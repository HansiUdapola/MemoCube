### Description

Memo Cube is a small game made with Unity 3D as a part of the assignment for collecting psychometrics data. The game has a 4x4 grid layout. Each of them is represented by a black cube. At the start, the game presents a colour pattern by changing the black colour to purple colour in a random order (Figure 4). The main task of the game is that the player needs to memorize the cube colour pattern in the exact order.  If the player fails to select the colour-coded cube in the displayed order, the player will not receive scores and  will have to repeat the current level. Each level consists of 4 stages (4 colour patterns); a player must complete all four stages to complete a level.

With the level increasing, the difficulty level also increases. In game design, the length of the colour pattern equals the sum of the current level and number of red cubes. Moreover, we mixed red and purple cubes to create the game. A red cube is added to each of the four levels. For example, if a player is in the 8th Level, the player will see eight (08) purple cubes and two (02) red cubes. When the player sees a red cube in the colour pattern, the player must ignore the red cube and remember only the purple (non-red) cube pattern. (Player should not be distracted by the red cube while memorizing the colour pattern). 
The colour pattern of red and purple cubes is randomly generated by the game.
